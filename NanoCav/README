NanoCav is a gce app written to simulate 3D nanophotonic cavities.

An example of a shifted L3 photonic crystal cavity is provided.

To execute the example, use the following Matlab commands:

% Create the simulation.
shifted_L3_example('L3_narrow.h5', [300 220 100], 20, 0.08116, 0.002, 30000);

% Simulate...

% Analyze data (mostly compute Q-factors).
NanoCav_analyze('L3_narrow.h5', 0.08, 12000)

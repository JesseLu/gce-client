NanoCav is a gce app written to simulate 3D nanophotonic cavities.

An example of a shifted L3 photonic crystal cavity is provided.

To execute the example, use the following Matlab commands:

% Make sure that we add the path to the gce-client package.
path(path, 'path-to-gce-client'); % For example: path(path, '..');


    % 
    % Simulation #1: Excite with broadband source.
    %

% First, we create a simulation with a broadband source.
shifted_L3_example('L3_broad.h5', [300 220 100], 20, 0.08, 0.02, 30000);

% Simulate and save the result to L3_broad.h5 (overwrite the initial file).

% Analyze the frequency response. Two peaks should be observed on the spectrum,
% we are interested in the lower energy (fundamental) mode at w = 0.08132.
NanoCav_analyze('L3_broad.h5', 0.08, 1000, false)

    
    %
    % Siulation #2: Excite with narrowband source.
    %

% Create the simulation with a narrowband source centered at 0.08132.
shifted_L3_example('L3_narrow.h5', [300 220 100], 20, 0.08132, 0.002, 30000);

% Simulate...

% Analyze data, and this time compute the Q-factors.
% A total Q-factor of *** should be observed.
NanoCav_analyze('L3_narrow.h5', 0.08, 12000, true)

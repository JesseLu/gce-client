SubGrid is a gce app that implements subgridding to an electromagnetic FDTD 
simulation. The subgridding method used is published in the following paper:
    Chevalier, Luebbers, and Cable, "FDTD Local Grid with Material Traverse,"
    IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, Vol 45 (1997).

Quickstart
----------
% Create simulation with 3:1 subgrid.
empty_subgrid_example('subgrid_example.h5', 3); 

% Simulate with gce...

% Watch main-grid and subgrid movie.
SubGrid_analyze('subgrid_example.h5', [50 50 50], 3, 1, 0);
